##  Datasets

### **EUVP (Enhancing Underwater Visual Perception) Dataset**

**Source:** [EUVP Dataset](https://irvlab.cs.umn.edu/resources/euvp-dataset)

**Description:**
The EUVP dataset contains both **paired** and **unpaired** underwater image sets categorized into *poor perceptual quality* and *good perceptual quality*. It is designed for training and evaluating supervised and unsupervised underwater image enhancement models.

**Details:**

* **Paired Data:** Consists of three subsets: *Underwater Dark*, *Underwater ImageNet*, and *Underwater Scenes* (e.g., 5,550 + 570 total images in the Underwater Dark subset).
* **Unpaired Data:** Includes poor-quality, good-quality, and validation sets (3,195 poor + 3,140 good + 330 validation = 6,665 images).
* **Usage:** Suitable for paired supervised learning and unpaired GAN-based enhancement.
* **License / Note:** Check the official dataset page for usage terms. Dataset is intended for research purposes only.
* **Ownership:** *I do not own this dataset. All rights belong to the original authors.*

### **UIEB (Underwater Image Enhancement Benchmark) Dataset**

**Source:** [UIEB Dataset – “An Underwater Image Enhancement Benchmark Dataset and Beyond”](https://li-chongyi.github.io/proj_benchmark.html)

**Description:**
UIEB is a large-scale real-world underwater image enhancement benchmark containing **950 underwater images**. Out of these, **890 images** have high-quality reference ground truths, while **60 are challenging images** without reference images.

**Details:**

* **890 raw underwater images** (~630 MB) along with **their reference images** (~786 MB).
* **60 challenging images** without reference ground truth.
* **Usage:** Commonly used for benchmarking, quantitative evaluation (PSNR, SSIM), and comparison against state-of-the-art underwater enhancement techniques.
* **License / Note:** The dataset is intended solely for academic use; redistribution is not permitted.
* **Ownership:** *I do not own this dataset. All rights belong to the authors of the UIEB benchmark.*
